# A Game in C with SDL

This is a starter project for games in C using [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org) for Window management, audio, images, fonts and more.

This will have you set up with basic asset loading of images, audio and fonts. A set of functions to render objects, update them over with with a `delta_time` float, and handle timing so that you get consistent frames-per-second on (almost) all machines.

## NOTE

This is a work in progress. I will be adding to it a lot and making quality of life improvements. However the basics are already there to start building a 2D game, without an engine. It's fun!

## Get Started

You will need the following SDL libraries ([found here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Libraries)) in your C compiler's expected library path:

- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_mixer
- SDL_ttf

This is built on Ubuntu Linux, but it should be fairly simple to get it working on Mac and Windows once you have the libraries in your C compiler's expected path.

Run it with `./build.sh && ./game`.
